    "E-commerce sites have thousands of listings everyday and at times, the users may not be correctly classifying their uploaded image or be using the wrong product depiction. Mismatch of product listing information will decrease the effectiveness of succssful transactions and also result in unnecessary resources being utilitzed to perform these corrections on a large scale. A product detection system would help to ensure the correct listing and categorization of products or to assist the user in classifying product types. To meet this need, an image classifer will be trained and developed to accurately identify the correct image labels with the use of neural networks."

    "This capstone project would be aimed at building an image classification model using convulated neural networks that will identify the following 3 categories of products: clothing, footwear and watches. The source data to construct this model will be based on images scraped from Amazon, the world's largest online retailer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders will be the e-commerce companies and the user of the services themselves. It will help the company improve the effectiveness of potential transactions. It will also improve the user experience with more accuracy and also to avoid problems arising from wrongly identifying products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics used to measure the performance would be the AUC & Type I / Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges foreseen would be potential imbalanced data, complex background noise or poor resolution images.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal at present seems to be sufficiently scoped as there are 3 categoeires of distinct image features an the quantity of images are adequate for the purposes of this analysis. The timeline for completion tentatively end of July 2020 is still a reasonable expectation to work towards to."
